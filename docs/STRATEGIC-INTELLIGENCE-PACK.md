## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Strategic Opportunity

**Cooperative ERP Lite** is positioned to capture Indonesia's **IDR 30+ Trillion cooperative digitalization market** through a unique timing convergence:

1. **80,000 new cooperatives** (Koperasi Merah Putih) launching July 2025 with **IDR 3B funding each**
2. **Government mandate**: Minimum 5% allocation to digitalization = **IDR 12T market opportunity**
3. **Greenfield advantage**: New cooperatives = zero legacy system lock-in
4. **First-mover**: No purpose-built cooperative platform exists in Indonesia

### Business Model

**SaaS + Platform + Transaction Fees**
- **Primary Revenue**: Monthly subscriptions (60% of revenue)
- **Secondary Revenue**: Implementation fees (20%), transaction fees (15%), government contracts (5%)
- **Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC ratio of 100:1, payback period < 1 month
- **Gross Margin**: 75-80% (SaaS-standard)

### Financial Projections (5-Year)

| Year | Customers | ARR | Total Revenue | EBITDA | Margin |
|------|-----------|-----|---------------|--------|--------|
| **1** | 4,000 | IDR 44B | IDR 82B | IDR 62B | 75% |
| **2** | 8,000 | IDR 96B | IDR 140B | IDR 109B | 78% |
| **3** | 12,000 | IDR 162B | IDR 210B | IDR 168B | 80% |
| **4** | 18,000 | IDR 270B | IDR 340B | IDR 272B | 80% |
| **5** | 25,000 | IDR 450B | IDR 540B | IDR 432B | 80% |

**5-Year Cumulative EBITDA: IDR 1.043 Trillion ($70M)**

### Key Success Factors

1. **First-Mover Advantage**: Capture Koperasi Merah Putih at launch (July 2025)
2. **Government Partnership**: Ministry of Cooperatives endorsement
3. **Purpose-Built Solution**: Only platform designed for Indonesian cooperative model
4. **Network Effects**: Inter-cooperative marketplace creates lock-in
5. **Zero-Cost Launch**: Fly.io + Neon + Vercel = $0/month for MVP (0-50 cooperatives)

### Strategic Positioning

**"Better than paper books = WIN"**

Our competition is manual record-keeping, not enterprise software. A 20% improvement over Excel represents a major win for 80% of cooperatives.

### Investment Requirements

**MVP Budget**: IDR 148.5M (~$10,000) for 12-week sprint
**Series A Target**: IDR 50-100B for national scale (Month 12-18)

## MARKET SIZING

### TAM/SAM/SOM Framework

#### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Definition:** Total market demand for cooperative digitalization in Indonesia

**Calculation:**
```
TAM = All Cooperatives × Average Digitalization Spend

Immediate Market (Koperasi Merah Putih):
80,000 cooperatives × IDR 150M digitalization budget = IDR 12 Trillion (one-time)

Ongoing Market (All Cooperatives):
207,302 total cooperatives (existing + new)
× IDR 1.5M average annual software spend
= IDR 310.9 Billion/year

Transaction Fees (long-term):
IDR 1,200T annual cooperative transactions
× 0.5% platform fee
= IDR 6 Trillion/year potential

TOTAL TAM: IDR 30+ Trillion annually (steady state)
```

**Assumptions:**
- Average cooperative has IDR 5-10B annual revenue
- 15% of revenue allocated to operations
- 1% of operational budget to software = IDR 50-100M/year
- Our platform captures 1.5M-3M per cooperative

#### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Definition:** Portion of TAM we can realistically serve

**Target Segments:**
- Koperasi Merah Putih: 80,000 (100% addressable)
- Existing medium-large cooperatives: 17,302 (addressable with features)
- Small cooperatives (growth path): 50,000 (50% addressable)
- BUMDes (adjacent market): 50,000 (addressable with customization)

**SAM Calculation:**
```
Addressable Cooperatives: 147,302

Conservative ARPU: IDR 1M/month

SAM = 147,302 × IDR 12M/year = IDR 1.77 Trillion/year
```

**Constraints Reducing TAM → SAM:**
- ❌ Micro cooperatives (< 50 members): Too small, can't afford software
- ❌ Dormant cooperatives: 30% of registered cooperatives inactive
- ❌ Cooperatives with existing long-term contracts: Locked in for 2-3 years
- ❌ Cooperatives with custom systems: High switching costs (10% of large cooperatives)

#### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Definition:** Market share we can realistically capture in 5 years

**Year 1-3 Strategy: Land Grab (Koperasi Merah Putih)**
```
Target: 5% of 80,000 = 4,000 cooperatives (Year 1)
ARPU: IDR 750K/month (blended)
Revenue: 4,000 × IDR 9M/year = IDR 36B

Year 3: 15% of 80,000 = 12,000 cooperatives
ARPU: IDR 1.2M/month (growth + upsell)
Revenue: 12,000 × IDR 14.4M/year = IDR 173B
```

**Year 4-5 Strategy: Existing + BUMDes Expansion**
```
Year 5 Target:
- Koperasi Merah Putih: 20,000 (25% market share)
- Existing cooperatives: 3,000 (2% of existing market)
- BUMDes: 2,000 (4% of BUMDes market)
- Total: 25,000 customers

ARPU: IDR 1.8M/month (mature customer base)
SOM = 25,000 × IDR 21.6M/year = IDR 540B
```

**SOM as % of SAM:**
- Year 1: 2% of SAM
- Year 3: 10% of SAM
- Year 5: 30% of SAM

### Market Sizing Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Source/Rationale |
|------------|-------|------------------|
| **Total cooperatives** | 207,302 | Ministry of Cooperatives (2024) |
| **Koperasi Merah Putih** | 80,000 | Government program announcement |
| **Active cooperatives** | 70% of total | Historical dormancy rate |
| **Addressable cooperatives** | 50-100% by segment | Size-based filtering |
| **Average ARPU** | IDR 600K-2.5M/mo | Segment-based pricing |
| **Market share (Year 1)** | 5% of new coops | First-mover advantage |
| **Market share (Year 5)** | 25% of new + 2% of existing | Category leadership |
| **Transaction fee potential** | 0.5% of GMV | Payment gateway standard |
| **Churn rate** | 5% annually | SaaS benchmark for SMB |

### Market Sizing Sensitivity Analysis

**Scenario 1: Conservative (1% Market Share)**
- Year 5 Customers: 2,000
- Year 5 Revenue: IDR 24B
- Outcome: Still profitable, slower growth

**Scenario 2: Realistic (5% Market Share)** ← Base Case
- Year 5 Customers: 25,000
- Year 5 Revenue: IDR 540B
- Outcome: Market leader, unicorn path

**Scenario 3: Optimistic (10% + Government Contracts)**
- Year 5 Customers: 35,000
- Year 5 Revenue: IDR 921B
- Outcome: Category dominance, IPO candidate

   - Improves cash flow predictability

2. **Auto-Debit Partnerships** (Secondary)
   - Partner with BRI, BNI (cooperative lenders)
   - Auto-debit from cooperative bank accounts
   - 95% collection rate vs. 80% manual

3. **Tiered Access System** (Tertiary)
   - Grace period: 7 days
   - Feature lock: 30 days overdue (read-only access)

### Four Actions Framework

#### ELIMINATE (Reduce Cost, Increase Value)

**What to Eliminate:**

1. ❌ **Complex Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-currency support (cooperatives are local)
   - Advanced manufacturing modules
   - Global compliance frameworks
   - **Why:** Adds complexity without value for cooperatives
   - **Impact:** 40% development time saved, simpler UX

2. ❌ **On-Premise Deployment**
   - Server infrastructure
   - IT staff requirements
   - Complex installations
   - **Why:** Cooperatives lack IT resources
   - **Impact:** 100% cloud = faster deployment, lower support costs

3. ❌ **Lengthy Implementations**
   - 6-12 month consulting engagements
   - Custom development per client
   - Waterfall project management
   - **Why:** Cooperatives need speed, not perfection
   - **Impact:** 2-week implementation vs. 6 months

4. ❌ **Per-User Pricing**
   - Complex licensing models
   - Seat-based restrictions
   - **Why:** Cooperative staff turnover is high
   - **Impact:** Flat pricing = predictable costs, easier sales

#### REDUCE (Below Industry Standard)

**What to Reduce:**

1. ⬇️ **Advanced Reporting**
   - Custom report builders
   - 100+ report templates
   - **Reduce to:** 8 essential reports (Balance Sheet, P&L, Member List, etc.)
   - **Why:** Cooperatives need basics, not analysis paralysis
   - **Impact:** 60% development time saved, faster time-to-value

2. ⬇️ **Customization Options**
   - Workflow customization
   - UI theming
   - **Reduce to:** Industry templates only (Transport, Retail, Agriculture)
   - **Why:** Standardization scales better
   - **Impact:** Lower support costs, faster deployments

3. ⬇️ **Integration Complexity**
   - Open API for everything
   - Middleware platforms
   - **Reduce to:** 5 key integrations (QRIS, banks, WhatsApp, NIK validation)
   - **Why:** Focus on must-haves, not nice-to-haves
   - **Impact:** 70% fewer integration support tickets

#### RAISE (Above Industry Standard)

**What to Raise:**

1. ⬆️ **Mobile Experience**
   - Industry: Desktop-first, mobile as afterthought
   - **Us:** Mobile-first, responsive design, PWA
   - **Why:** Cooperative staff use smartphones, not laptops
   - **Impact:** 3x higher engagement, broader addressable market

2. ⬆️ **Member Transparency**
   - Industry: Admin-only access
   - **Us:** Every member sees their data (share capital, SHU, transactions)
   - **Why:** Cooperative principle = member ownership
   - **Impact:** Builds trust, reduces treasurer burden, unique selling point

3. ⬆️ **Implementation Speed**
   - Industry: 3-6 months
   - **Us:** 2 weeks (goal: 7 days by Year 2)
   - **Why:** Time-to-value is competitive advantage
   - **Impact:** Faster revenue recognition, better cash flow

4. ⬆️ **Government Compliance**
   - Industry: Generic templates
   - **Us:** SAK ETAP built-in, RAT reports automated, Ministry reporting one-click
   - **Why:** Compliance is pain point, not feature request
   - **Impact:** Eliminates objection, becomes requirement

#### CREATE (New Value Never Offered)

**What to Create:**

1. ✨ **Inter-Cooperative Marketplace** (Phase 2)
   - **What:** Platform for cooperatives to buy/sell to each other
   - **Why:** IDR 200T in inter-cooperative transactions currently offline
   - **Example:** Coffee cooperative sells to consumer cooperative
   - **Revenue Model:** 1% transaction fee
   - **Impact:** Network effects, lock-in, new revenue stream

2. ✨ **Cooperative Credit Scoring** (Phase 2)
   - **What:** Aggregate data creates credit scores for cooperatives
   - **Why:** Banks lack data to lend to cooperatives
   - **Example:** Cooperative with 95% loan repayment rate gets preferential rates
   - **Revenue Model:** Data licensing to banks
   - **Impact:** Financial inclusion, partnership revenue

3. ✨ **Village Economy Dashboard** (Government Contracts)
   - **What:** Real-time dashboard for Ministry/Provincial offices
   - **Why:** Government has no visibility into cooperative health
   - **Example:** See which cooperatives are struggling, intervene proactively
   - **Revenue Model:** Government contracts (IDR 5-10B/year)
   - **Impact:** Government endorsement, credibility boost

4. ✨ **Cooperative-Specific Features:**
   - **SHU (Profit Sharing) Calculation:** Automated, SAK ETAP compliant
   - **Member Portal:** Mobile app for members to see balances
   - **RAT (Annual Meeting) Automation:** Generate presentations, reports
   - **Multi-Business Unit:** Track retail, loans, agriculture separately
   - **Why:** No existing software handles these cooperative-specific needs
   - **Impact:** Category creation, no direct competition

### Value Innovation

**Price:**
- Eliminate: Enterprise pricing (IDR 10-500M/year)
- Create: Cooperative-friendly pricing (IDR 500K-2M/month)
- **Result:** 95% cheaper than enterprise ERP, affordable for 90% of cooperatives

**Buyer Utility:**
- Eliminate: Complexity (200-page manuals, 6-month training)
- Create: Simplicity (mobile-first, 2-hour training)
- **Result:** 10x faster time-to-value

**Adoption Barriers:**
- Eliminate: High switching costs (6-12 month implementations)
- Create: Fast migration (2-week setup, automated data import)
- **Result:** Reduces "do nothing" option

### Blue Ocean Strategic Profile

**What Makes Us Different:**

| Factor | Red Ocean (Accounting SW) | Blue Ocean (Us) | Impact |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Target Market** | Generic SMEs | Indonesian Cooperatives Only | Focused value proposition |
| **Key Feature** | Double-entry bookkeeping | SHU Calculation + Member Portal | Unique selling point |
| **Pricing** | Per-user (IDR 50K/user/mo) | Flat rate (IDR 500K/coop/mo) | Predictable costs |
| **Deployment** | 1-3 months | 2 weeks | Faster revenue |
| **Support** | Email/ticket | Local agents + WhatsApp | Cultural fit |
| **Compliance** | Generic | SAK ETAP + Indonesian law | Eliminates objection |
| **Network Effects** | None | Marketplace + data insights | Lock-in increases with usage |

**Category Creation:**

We're not "better accounting software" → We're the **first Cooperative Operating System**

**Why This Matters:**
- No direct competition (we define the category)
- Premium pricing power (no alternatives)
- Government partnerships (category leader status)
- Media coverage (innovation story)

## GROWTH LEVERS

### Organic Growth Levers

**Lever 1: Government Mandate Enforcement**

**Mechanism:**
- Presidential Regulation No. 12/2024 requires digital reporting by 2026
- Cooperatives must use compliant software or face penalties
- We ensure compliance built-in

**Impact:**
- Eliminates "do nothing" option
- Shortens sales cycle from 6 months → 2 months
- Increases addressable market by +30%

**Execution:**

- Marketing message: "Be compliant by 2026 deadline"
- Free compliance checklist tool (lead magnet)

**Expected Contribution:** +IDR 50B ARR by Year 3

---

**Lever 2: Network Effects (Inter-Cooperative Marketplace)**

**Mechanism:**
- Phase 2 feature: Cooperatives can buy/sell to each other on platform
- Example: Coffee cooperative → Consumer cooperative
- We take 1% transaction fee

**Impact:**
- Switching costs increase exponentially (lose marketplace access)
- Viral growth (cooperative joins to access marketplace)
- New revenue stream (transaction fees)

**Execution:**
- Launch with 500+ cooperatives (critical mass)
- Incentivize early marketplace users (0% fee for 6 months)
- Target: 20% of cooperatives use marketplace by Year 3

**Expected Contribution:** +IDR 20B transaction revenue by Year 3

---

**Lever 3: Referral Program & Word-of-Mouth**

**Mechanism:**

**Mechanism:**
- Free tier for micro cooperatives (< 50 members)

- Upsell to paid tier when they outgrow limits

**Impact:**
- Low barrier to entry (viral adoption)
- Try before buy (higher conversion)
- Longer sales funnel but higher volume

**Execution:**
- Launch in Year 2 after paid tier is proven
- Target conversion rate: 30% free → paid within 12 months
- Automated upgrade prompts at usage limits

**Expected Contribution:** +5,000 customers by Year 3

### Pricing Psychology Tactics

**1. Charm Pricing (Ending in 9)**
- IDR 499,000 (not 500,000) → Feels like "400s"
- IDR 99,000 (not 100,000) → "Under 100k" barrier
- IDR 49,000 (not 50,000) → Small items feel "cheap"

**2. Anchoring**
- Show crossed-out "Regular Price" with "Launch Price"
- Example: ~~IDR 750,000~~ → **IDR 499,000** (Save 33%!)

**3. Decoy Pricing**
- 3-tier pricing with "Most Popular" middle tier
- Enterprise tier makes Professional tier look reasonable

**4. Bundling**
- Bundles show total value (IDR 2,496,000) vs. bundled price (IDR 1,747,200)
- Savings highlighted in IDR (more impressive than %)

---

### Discount Strategy

**Strategic Discounts (✅ Use These):**

1. **Annual Prepayment: 17% off** (2 months free)
   - Improves cash flow
   - Reduces churn (already paid)

2. **Volume Discounts:**
   - 3+ modules: 10% off
   - 5+ modules: 20% off
   - 8+ modules: 30% off

3. **Early Adopter: 50% off setup fee**
   - First 100 customers

   - Viral growth

5. **Seasonal Promotions: 15-25% off**
   - End of year, tax season, Ramadan
   - Quarterly sales spikes

**Avoid (❌):**
- Random discounts (devalues product)
- Discount on request (trains customers to negotiate)
- Permanent "sale" pricing (loses credibility)
