## Pricing Psychology

### Principle 1: Charm Pricing (Ending in 9)

**Why it works:**
- Numbers ending in 9 are perceived as significantly lower
- "499,000" feels much cheaper than "500,000" (even though it's only 1,000 difference)
- Reduces "pain of paying" psychologically

**Application:**

| Instead of | Use | Perception Difference |
|------------|-----|----------------------|
| IDR 500,000 | **IDR 499,000** | Feels like "400s" not "500s" |
| IDR 100,000 | **IDR 99,000** | "Under 100k" psychological barrier |
| IDR 50,000 | **IDR 49,000** | Small items feel "cheap" |
| IDR 200,000 | **IDR 199,000** | Anchors to 100s range |
| IDR 1,500,000 | **IDR 1,499,000** | "Less than 1.5 million" |

**Evidence:**
- MIT study: $39 products sell 24% more than $40 products
- ".99" pricing increases sales by 8-15% on average

---

### Principle 2: Price Anchoring

**Strategy:** Show high price first to make actual price seem reasonable

**Example:**

```
❌ Bad Presentation:
"Vehicle Rental Module: IDR 499,000"

✅ Good Presentation:
"Vehicle Rental Module
Regular Price: IDR 750,000
Launch Price: IDR 499,000 (Save 33%!)"
```

**Application in Module Catalog:**

| Module | Anchor Price | Actual Price | Perceived Savings |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Vehicle Rental | ~~IDR 750,000~~ | **IDR 499,000** | Save IDR 251,000 |
| Advanced Inventory | ~~IDR 450,000~~ | **IDR 299,000** | Save IDR 151,000 |
| Patient Records | ~~IDR 2,000,000~~ | **IDR 1,499,000** | Save IDR 501,000 |

**Result:** Customers feel they're getting a deal, even though "anchor price" is arbitrary!

---

### Principle 3: Decoy Pricing (Compromise Effect)

**Strategy:** Add a "decoy" option to make target option look attractive

**Example: 3-Tier Pricing**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Module Pricing Options                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  ○ Basic Tier                           │
│    IDR 99,000 setup + IDR 49,000/mo    │
│    Limited features                     │
│                                         │
│  ● Professional Tier  ← 70% choose this│
│    IDR 499,000 setup + IDR 99,000/mo   │
│    Full features                        │
│    ⭐ MOST POPULAR                      │
│                                         │
│  ○ Enterprise Tier (Decoy!)             │
│    IDR 1,499,000 setup + IDR 199,000/mo│
│    Same features + priority support     │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Basic = Too limited (rejected)
- Enterprise = Too expensive (rejected, but makes Professional look reasonable!)
- **Professional = "Just right"** (70% choose this)

**Data:** Adding a premium tier increases sales of middle tier by 30-40%

---

### Principle 4: Bundling & Perceived Value

**Unbundled (Low perceived value):**
```
Vehicle Rental: IDR 499,000
Fleet Management: IDR 699,000
Fuel Tracking: IDR 299,000
Total: IDR 1,497,000
```

**Bundled (High perceived value):**
```
🚗 Transport Complete Package
✓ Vehicle Rental
✓ Fleet Management
✓ Fuel Tracking
✓ Bonus: SMS Notifications

Regular Price: IDR 1,497,000
Bundle Price: IDR 999,000
💰 SAVE IDR 498,000 (33% OFF!)
```

**Result:** Same features, but bundle feels like a "steal"!

---

### Principle 5: Payment Framing

**Annual vs Monthly Pricing:**

```
❌ Bad Framing:
"IDR 1,188,000 per year"

✅ Good Framing:
"Just IDR 99,000/month (billed annually)
Save 2 months compared to monthly billing!"
```

**Breakdown Comparison:**

| Billing | Monthly Price | Effective Yearly | Customer Perception |
|---------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Monthly** | IDR 99,000 | IDR 1,188,000 | Higher price awareness |
| **Annual (no discount)** | - | IDR 1,188,000 | Sticker shock! |
| **Annual (discounted)** | "Just IDR 83,250/month" | IDR 999,000 | Great deal! |

**Psychological Win:**
- Shows monthly equivalent (familiar)
- Annual discount seems generous (even if margin is same)
- Improves cash flow for you
- Reduces churn (pre-paid)

---

## Value-Based Pricing Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Customer ROI

**Formula:**
```
Customer ROI = (Value Created - Price Paid) / Price Paid × 100%
```

**Example: Vehicle Rental Module**

**Value Created:**
- Increase vehicle utilization: +25%
- Revenue per vehicle: IDR 10,000,000/month
- Additional revenue: IDR 2,500,000/month (25% × 10M)
- Reduced manual work: 20 hours/month × IDR 50,000/hour = IDR 1,000,000
- **Total monthly value: IDR 3,500,000**

**Price:**
- Setup: IDR 499,000 (one-time)
- Monthly: IDR 99,000

**Customer ROI:**
```
Month 1: (3,500,000 - 499,000 - 99,000) / 598,000 = 483% ROI
Month 2+: (3,500,000 - 99,000) / 99,000 = 3,335% ROI per month!
```

**Conclusion:** At IDR 99,000/month, customer saves IDR 3.4M monthly = **34x return**!

**Pricing Insight:** You could charge **10x more** and customer would still have positive ROI!

---

### Step 2: Value Ladder Pricing

Price based on value delivered, not cost to build:

| Module | Development Cost | Value to Customer (monthly) | Recommended Price | Value Multiplier |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Advanced Inventory** | IDR 4,500,000 | IDR 10,000,000 (reduced overstocking) | IDR 299,000 setup + IDR 99,000/mo | 100x annual value |
| **Vehicle Rental** | IDR 10,500,000 | IDR 3,500,000 (efficiency gains) | IDR 499,000 setup + IDR 99,000/mo | 35x annual value |
| **Patient Records** | IDR 18,000,000 | IDR 5,000,000 (compliance + efficiency) | IDR 1,499,000 setup + IDR 199,000/mo | 25x annual value |
| **Micro-Lending** | IDR 22,500,000 | IDR 20,000,000 (loan portfolio mgmt) | IDR 2,499,000 setup + IDR 299,000/mo | 60x annual value |

**Pricing Rule:** Charge **10-30% of annual value created**

---

### Step 3: Willingness-to-Pay Research

**Survey Results (Hypothetical - but based on Indonesian market):**

**Question:** "How much would you pay per month for a vehicle rental management system?"

| Price Point | % Would Buy | Cumulative % | Revenue at 100 Customers |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| IDR 0 | 100% | 100% | IDR 0 |
| IDR 25,000 | 90% | 90% | IDR 2,250,000 |
| IDR 50,000 | 75% | 75% | IDR 3,750,000 |
| **IDR 99,000** | **60%** | **60%** | **IDR 5,940,000** ✅ |
| IDR 150,000 | 40% | 40% | IDR 6,000,000 |
| IDR 200,000 | 25% | 25% | IDR 5,000,000 |
| IDR 300,000 | 10% | 10% | IDR 3,000,000 |

**Optimal Price Point:** IDR 99,000/month
- 60% adoption rate
- Maximizes total revenue
- Still delivers 35x value to customers

**Sweet Spot Analysis:**
```
Below IDR 99,000: Higher adoption but lower revenue
Above IDR 150,000: Adoption drops too fast
IDR 99,000-149,000: Revenue plateau zone

Recommended: IDR 99,000 (rounds nicely, psychological pricing)
```

Break-even: 53 customer-months (4.4 years with 1 customer!)
```

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **Risky** (too slow to break even)

---

### Model C: Setup Fee + Monthly Subscription (RECOMMENDED)

**Structure:**
- Setup fee: IDR 299,000 - IDR 2,499,000 (recovers 50-100% dev cost)

### Bundle Psychology

**Why 30% discount works:**

1. **Anchoring Effect:**
   - Show crossed-out "individual price"
   - Highlight savings in IDR (more impressive than %)

2. **Value Stacking:**
   - List each module separately
   - Shows what customer gets
   - Increases perceived value

3. **Decision Simplification:**
   - Don't make customer choose modules
   - Pre-packaged = "expert recommendation"
   - Removes analysis paralysis

4. **Higher AOV (Average Order Value):**
   - Customer might buy 1 module individually
   - Bundle pushes to 4 modules
   - 4x revenue per customer!

---

## Discount Strategy

### When to Offer Discounts

**✅ Strategic Discounts (Use These):**

1. **Annual Prepayment:**
   - 15-20% off when paying annually
   - Improves cash flow
   - Reduces churn (already paid)

2. **Volume Discounts:**
   - 3+ modules: 10% off
   - 5+ modules: 20% off
   - 8+ modules (all): 30% off

3. **Early Adopter:**
   - First 100 customers: 50% off setup fee
   - Creates urgency
   - Builds testimonials

4. **Referral Program:**
   - Refer a customer: 1 month free
   - Both parties benefit
   - Viral growth

5. **Seasonal Promotions:**
   - End of year: "Close your books with our system! 25% off"
   - Tax season: "Tax prep made easy! Special pricing"
   - Ramadan: "Ramadan Mubarak special"

**❌ Avoid These Discounts:**

1. ❌ Random discounts (devalues product)
2. ❌ Discount on request (trains customers to negotiate)
3. ❌ Permanent "sale" pricing (loses credibility)
4. ❌ Deep discounts (> 50%) except for early adopters

### Discount Calculation Example

**Scenario: Small retail cooperative wants 2 modules**

**Full Price:**
```
Base: IDR 499,000/month
Advanced Inventory: IDR 499,000 setup + IDR 99,000/mo
Supplier Management: IDR 499,000 setup + IDR 99,000/mo

Total Setup: IDR 998,000
Total Monthly: IDR 697,000
```

**With Multi-Module Discount (10%):**
```
Base: IDR 499,000/month (no discount)
Modules Setup: IDR 898,200 (10% off)
Modules Monthly: IDR 178,200 (10% off)

Total Setup: IDR 898,200 (save IDR 99,800)
Total Monthly: IDR 677,200 (save IDR 19,800/mo)
Annual Savings: IDR 337,400
```

**With Annual Prepayment (additional 17%):**
```
Annual Billing:
Base: IDR 4,999,000/year (17% off monthly rate)
Modules: IDR 1,782,000/year (17% off monthly rate)

Total: IDR 6,781,000/year
vs. Monthly: IDR 8,126,400/year
SAVE: IDR 1,345,400 (20% total savings!)
```

**Customer wins:** Big savings
**You win:** Upfront cash + lower churn

---

## Price Testing Framework

### A/B Testing Strategy

**Test 1: Setup Fee vs. No Setup Fee**

```
Group A (Control):
- Setup: IDR 499,000
- Monthly: IDR 99,000

Group B (Test):
- Setup: IDR 0
- Monthly: IDR 149,000

Run for: 60 days
Measure:
- Conversion rate
- Customer LTV
- Churn rate (6 months)
```

**Hypothesis:** No setup fee increases conversion but higher churn

---

**Test 2: Price Point Elasticity**

```
Test different monthly prices for same module:

Group A: IDR 79,000/month
Group B: IDR 99,000/month (control)
Group C: IDR 129,000/month

Run for: 90 days
Measure:
- Conversion rate
- Revenue per customer
- Total revenue
```

**Goal:** Find revenue-maximizing price point

---

**Test 3: Bundle vs. Individual**

```
Group A: Individual modules only
Group B: Show bundles + individual
Group C: Bundles only (hide individual)

Measure:
- Average Order Value
- Modules per customer
- Total revenue
```

---

### Revenue Maximization Formula

```
Total Revenue = (Base ARPU × Customers) +
                (Module Revenue × Adoption Rate × Customers) +
                (Setup Fees × New Module Customers)
```

**Optimization Levers:**

1. **Increase Base ARPU:** ✅
   - Current: IDR 499,000
   - Strategy: Annual billing discount (improves cash flow, not ARPU)
   - Keep base pricing stable

2. **Increase Module Adoption:** ✅✅✅ (Biggest lever!)
   - Current: 30%
   - Target: 50%
   - Tactics:
     - In-app prompts
     - Email campaigns
     - Success stories
     - Free trials (14 days)
     - Onboarding calls
     - Module recommendations based on industry

3. **Increase Modules per Customer:** ✅✅
   - Current: 1.2 modules/customer
   - Target: 2.0 modules/customer
   - Tactics:
     - Bundle discounts
     - Cross-sell campaigns
     - "Customers like you also use..."

4. **Optimize Setup Fees:** ✅
   - Current: Average IDR 499,000
   - Target: Segment-based (IDR 99,000 - IDR 1,499,000)
   - Higher for enterprise, lower for micro
