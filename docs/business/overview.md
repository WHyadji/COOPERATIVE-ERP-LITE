# Cooperative ERP Lite - Business Overview

## Executive Summary

Cooperative ERP Lite is Indonesia's first **Cooperative Operating System** - a digital platform designed specifically for the Indonesian cooperative model, particularly targeting the 80,000 Koperasi Merah Putih being launched in July 2025.

**Positioning**: "Cooperative Operating System"

The first digital platform designed specifically for Indonesian cooperative management. We handle the complexity of multi-stakeholder ownership, bridge traditional gotong-royong values with modern technology, and enable 80,000 village economies to connect digitally.

Unlike traditional ERP systems that cost millions and are built for corporations, or generic accounting software that doesn't understand cooperatives, we are purpose-built for the unique needs of Indonesian cooperatives - from member management and SHU calculation to government compliance and village-level operations.

## The Problem We Solve

### Current Situation

Indonesian cooperatives face significant operational challenges:

1. **Manual Operations**
   - Most cooperatives use manual books or Excel spreadsheets
   - Prone to errors and data loss
   - Time-consuming data entry and reconciliation
   - No standardization across cooperatives

2. **Financial Transparency Issues**
   - No transparency in financial management
   - Members can't track their deposits or SHU (profit sharing) entitlement
   - Difficult to verify cooperative performance
   - Trust issues between members and management

3. **Fragmented Systems**
   - Multiple disconnected systems for different business units
   - No integration between POS, accounting, and member management
   - Data silos prevent holistic view
   - Duplication of effort

4. **Compliance Challenges**
   - Can't generate reports required by government (Ministry of Cooperatives)
   - Manual report preparation takes weeks
   - No real-time visibility of cooperative performance
   - Difficulty meeting regulatory requirements

### Impact of Current Problems

**For Members:**
- Loss of trust in cooperative management
- Can't verify their share capital or savings
- Unclear SHU calculation and distribution
- Poor service experience

**For Management:**
- Board makes decisions without accurate data
- Lack of real-time financial visibility
- High operational costs
- Difficulty scaling operations

**For Government:**
- Government audits find problems frequently
- No standardized data across cooperatives
- Difficult to monitor 127,000+ cooperatives
- Can't track economic impact at village level

**Systemic Risks:**
- Corruption and mismanagement risks
- Young people don't want to join "outdated" cooperatives
- Cooperatives fail to compete with modern retailers
- Economic potential of cooperatives unrealized
