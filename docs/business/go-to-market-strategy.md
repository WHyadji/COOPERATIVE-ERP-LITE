## GTM Strategy Overview

### Strategic Approach

**Philosophy**: "Land and Expand" through Government Partnership

Our go-to-market strategy leverages the unique opportunity of 80,000 Koperasi Merah Putih launching simultaneously, combined with government support and cooperative network effects.

### Three-Phase Rollout

                        ↓
Phase 3 (Months 10-24): NATIONAL SCALE - Nationwide Dominance
```

### Core GTM Principles

1. **Government Partnership First**: Leverage Ministry relationships for credibility
2. **Cooperative Networks**: Use cooperative associations for referrals
3. **Show, Don't Tell**: Demo-driven sales with immediate value proof
