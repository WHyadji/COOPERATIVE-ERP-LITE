2. **Affordable**: 70% cheaper than alternatives
3. **Scalable**: Grow with cooperative size
4. **Predictable**: Monthly/annual subscriptions
5. **Transparent**: No hidden fees

### Pricing Tactics

**1. Freemium Model**
- Free tier for acquisition
- 30% conversion rate target
- Low-cost entry barrier

**2. Annual Discounts**
- 17% discount for annual prepayment
- Improve cash flow
- Reduce churn

**3. Volume Discounts (Enterprise)**
- 10% discount for 5+ cooperatives (group buying)
- 20% discount for provincial contracts

**4. Promotional Pricing (Launch)**
- **Year 1 Promo**: 30% off for first 1,000 customers

- **Referral Program**: 1 month free for each referral

**5. Bundling**
- Implementation + 1 year subscription: 15% total discount

### Price Elasticity Considerations

**Low Price Sensitivity** (will pay more):

**High Price Sensitivity** (price-conscious):
- Small, rural cooperatives
- Cooperatives with tight margins
- Manual system users (need education)

**Strategy**: Tiered pricing captures both segments

## Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions:**
- Average customer tenure: 5 years
- Average ARPU: IDR 1M/month
- Gross margin: 75%
- Annual price increases: 5%

**Calculation:**
```
Year 1: IDR 12M × 75% = IDR 9M
Year 2: IDR 12.6M × 75% = IDR 9.45M
Year 3: IDR 13.23M × 75% = IDR 9.92M
Year 4: IDR 13.89M × 75% = IDR 10.42M
Year 5: IDR 14.59M × 75% = IDR 10.94M

LTV = IDR 49.73M ≈ IDR 50M
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Blended CAC Target**: IDR 500K

**Breakdown by Channel:**
- Direct sales: IDR 800K per customer
- Government partnership: IDR 200K per customer
- Referrals: IDR 100K per customer
- Organic: IDR 50K per customer

**Year 1 Mix:**
- Direct: 40% × IDR 800K = IDR 320K
- Government: 30% × IDR 200K = IDR 60K
- Referrals: 20% × IDR 100K = IDR 20K
- Organic: 10% × IDR 50K = IDR 5K
- **Blended CAC**: IDR 405K

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Target**: > 5:1
**Actual**: IDR 50M : IDR 500K = **100:1** (excellent)

### Payback Period

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly gross profit per customer = IDR 1M × 75% = IDR 750K
CAC = IDR 500K
Payback = 500K / 750K = 0.67 months ≈ 20 days
```

**Target**: < 6 months
**Actual**: **< 1 month** (excellent)

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Metrics

**MRR Growth Rate Target**: 20% month-over-month (Year 1)

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**: > 110%
- Upsells + expansion - churn

**Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)**: > 95%
- 1 - revenue churn rate
