# Debug Issue: $ARGUMENTS

Investigate and fix the issue: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Debugging Process
1. **Issue Understanding**
   - Reproduce the issue if possible
   - Gather relevant error messages/logs
   - Identify affected components

2. **Investigation**
   - Search codebase for related code
   - Check recent changes that might be related
   - Review logs and error traces
   - Identify potential root causes

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Analyze the most likely causes
   - Test hypotheses systematically
   - Identify the exact problem

4. **Solution Development**
   - Design a fix that addresses root cause
   - Consider impact on other parts of system
   - Implement the solution
   - Add safeguards to prevent recurrence

5. **Testing & Verification**
   - Test the fix thoroughly
   - Verify the original issue is resolved
   - Check for any regressions
   - Add tests to prevent future issues

6. **Documentation**
   - Document the root cause
   - Explain the solution approach
   - Update any relevant documentation

Please think step by step and provide a thorough investigation.
